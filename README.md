# arcada
Arcade, in the future - a new plugin for visualizing particles in Niagara Particle System.
In order to try new presets in your projects - import assets.
The main asset is the blueprint class itself for communicating sound with the Niagara particle system.
To contact me and my team - write to me in telegram - @skadiboy.
